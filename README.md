This is a full stack python application i built in the django framework, it still need to be finished but so far i love the way it is coming along.
This application is suppose to replicate a pokedex from the Pokemon franchise series, which is a database that stores all of the specific pokemons information.
I plan on adding a graph to represent a Pokemon's attributes compared to others, being attack, defense, special attack and special defense in the more info sections. I also plan to improve the CSS portion of this project as it still needs alot of work, but im happy the way it looks now.
